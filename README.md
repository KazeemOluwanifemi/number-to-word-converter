# Number to Words Converter (Java) 🏗️ *(Work in Progress)*

This is a simple **Java** program that takes an integer input from the user and converts it into its corresponding English word representation.

For example:

* `0` → **Zero**
* `105` → **One Hundred Five**
* `31245` → **Thirty One Thousand Two Hundred Forty Five**
* `100000` → **One Hundred Thousand**

* **Supports decimal numbers** *(newly added)*.
* Clean and readable English word output.
* Handles:
